Syed Furqan – Portfolio Website (Data & Business Analyst)

This is my personal portfolio website that I designed and developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this website to present my profile, skills, and projects in a clean and professional way for clients and companies.

Instead of using any template or framework, I wrote everything myself so I could have full control over the design, layout, and user experience.

What this website includes

A modern hero section with a clear professional message

A short introduction about me in the footer section

An interactive FAQ section where content is loaded using JavaScript

A projects section that opens in a full-screen page and shows project cards dynamically

A contact page with a clean form layout

Fully responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

Simple, clean, and business-focused UI

How this website is built

This project is built using only:

HTML for structure

CSS for layout, design, and responsiveness

JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content (FAQ, projects, page navigation, form handling)

All the code is written in a single file for simplicity and easy deployment.

A few technical details

The FAQ and Projects sections are generated from JavaScript arrays

The Projects and Contact sections open and close using JavaScript (popup-style pages)

The contact form currently shows a confirmation message and can be connected to any backend later

The layout is fully responsive using custom CSS (no Bootstrap or any framework)

Why I built this

I built this website to:

Use it as my personal portfolio

Show my work to international clients

Demonstrate my front-end and UI skills along with my analytics background

Have a simple, fast, and professional personal website
